# Hey there! 👋 I'm Venkata

### Backend Engineer | Framework Builder | Automation Enthusiast

I'm a software engineer who gets genuinely excited about building things that make other developers' lives easier. Whether it's crafting automation frameworks that cut release cycles by 95%, or architecting backend systems that just _work_ — I love solving problems with clean, scalable code.

Currently pursuing my **MSc in Electronic and Computer Technology (IoT)** at Dublin City University 🇮🇪, diving deeper into the intersection of software and hardware.

## 🔧 What I Build

```python
class Venkata:
    def __init__(self):
        self.code = ["Python", "C", "C++", "Rust"]
        self.backend = ["Django", "Flask", "REST APIs"]
        self.devops = ["Linux", "Docker", "Jenkins", "CI/CD"]
        self.validation = ["TestStand", "LabVIEW", "Robot Framework"]

    def current_focus(self):
        return "Building scalable frameworks & exploring IoT"
```

## 🚀 Things I'm Proud Of

- 📉 **95% reduction** in release effort through parallel execution frameworks
- ⚡ **60% faster** dashboard load times via Django optimization
- 🔄 **93% faster** validation cycles with automated measurement workflows
- 🧪 **90%+ test coverage** on production backend systems
- 🏆 **1st place** in company-wide LabVIEW speed coding competition

## 🌱 Currently Exploring

- 🦀 Getting my hands dirty with **Rust**
- 🌐 Deep diving into **IoT architectures** and edge computing
- 🤖 Automation patterns that scale across teams
- 📊 Building better observability into frameworks

## 🎯 What Drives Me

I believe great software isn't just about writing code — it's about building **tools that empower teams**. There's something deeply satisfying about seeing a framework you built being used by 10+ engineers daily, or watching a dashboard you optimized load in milliseconds instead of seconds.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me volunteering with **Dublin City Volunteers** or geeking out over embedded systems projects.
